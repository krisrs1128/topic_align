This directory contains the scripts for simulating
data to explore the empirical asymptotic behavior of
topic alignment and associated diagnostic scores as
the number of samples increases.

Simulations were run on the Stanford Sherlock servers
using the script "alto-lda-asymptotic.sh".
This script execute "run_simulations_for_asymptotic_behavior.Rmd"
within a singularity container (singularity_alto).
The results are stored in a directory "lda-asymptotic"
(which not in this repo due to its size), and analysed with
"simulation-analyses.Rmd" which calls function in the "R/" directory,
and produces figures stored in "figures/".

To reproduce these simulations:

1. build the singularity images on a linux machine on which you have "sudo" rights.
(I did it using a vagrant virtual machine on my laptop)
2. Transfer the image on computing clusters where singularity is available.
3. Adapt the "alto-lda-asymptotic.sh" script to fit your clusters requirements
4. Run the simulations with that script.
5. Analyse the results with "simulation-analyses.Rmd"
